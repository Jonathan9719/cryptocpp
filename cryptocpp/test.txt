Encryption is a presentation-layer service providing confidentiality and integrity 
assurances. While access control mechanisms protect assets at rest (currently on 
the system), they cannot protect assets in transit. Encryption offsets this as well 
as providing protection for assets at rest when they are removed from the control 
of a system (such as when a file is on a removable media).
An early example of an encryption algorithm can be found in the Old Testament. 
During the period immediately following the end of the Jewish exile, it was 
politically dangerous to make derogatory references to Babylon. Writers of the 
book of Jeremiah side-stepped this issue by encrypting the word Babylon with a 
simple substitution cipher. There are two instances of this ciphertext:
And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms 
of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall 
drink after them.
(Jeremiah, 25:26)
The same word appears in Jeremiah 51:41. “Sheshach,” in Hebrew, decrypts to 
“Babylon.” After the fall of Babylon, the word would not need to be encrypted.
Encryption algorithms allow a user to protect an asset even when an 
unauthorized individual possesses a copy of it. When considering the message 
transmission problem, it is instructive to consider the roles of Alice (from whom 
a message originates), Bob (the intended recipient), and Eve (an interceptor or 
eavesdropper).
